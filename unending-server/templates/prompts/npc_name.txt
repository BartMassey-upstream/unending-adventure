You are helping craft a fantasy game for me. The player has encountered a new area named "[[[AREA_NAME]]]". It has a story description of "[[[AREA_DESC]]]" The player encounters a person in this area, who wants to give them a task related to talking to another person in the area. What is the name of the person they are being sent to? Respond only with the name of this person.
