You are helping craft a fantasy game for me. The player has encountered a new area named "[[[AREA_NAME]]]". It has a story description of "[[[AREA_DESC]]]" The player encounters a person in this area, who wants to give them a task related to retrieving [[[ITEM_COUNT]]] of a particular type of item. What type of item do they want the player to collect? Respond only with the name of the item.
