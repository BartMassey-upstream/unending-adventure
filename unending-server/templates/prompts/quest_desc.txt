You are helping craft a fantasy game for me. The player has encountered a new area named "[[[AREA_NAME]]]". It has a story description of "[[[AREA_DESC]]]" The player encounters a person named [[[GIVER_NAME]]] who wants them to [[[QUEST_TASK]]]. Write a dialogue for the giving of this quest, from the perspective of [[[GIVER_NAME]]]. Do not include the mention of specific numbers or quantities. Do not mention a reward of any kind. Respond only with [[[GIVER_NAME]]]'s dialogue.
